# [L4D/2] Boss "NOTHREAT" Attribute Fix
This is a SourceMod Plugin that fixes an issue where the Director would spawn Boss infected in areas that have the `NOTHREAT` nav area attribute, in versus mode. **This issue is only present when the Director spawns them on the survivors' path**.

This plugin is quite handy when you want to prevent tanks and witches from spawning on edges where there's a risk of them falling down, e.g. The Parish finale.
